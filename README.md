This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates the error of multiple mutable borrows. The program attempts to create two mutable references to the same variable, which is not allowed in Rust because it could lead to data races.  The solution shows how to avoid this error using techniques like cloning, interior mutability, or refactoring the code to avoid the need for multiple mutable borrows.
